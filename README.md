# Desktop-Reminder
I don't know about you but I forget almost everything so I made this script.

## How it works
This script uses a empty template ( template.jpg ) and when you entered what you want, 
the text will be added to the template with the font `Calibri`, like this:

![alt text]( ./rtw.jpg "reminder wallpaper")

##

### You know
You can replace your **template and color** you want to write and even the font.

Just run it: ``$ python3.x desktop-reminder.py`` 

This script is now very simple. I look forward to your opinions to make this better.

**NOTE:** This script is using the template I added so the positioning of the text is based on this photo.
If you added new template remember to adjust the positions (x, y)s.

**Enjoy**
